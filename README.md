# sentiment-analysis-of-twitter-data-using-R-language
R is used for sentiment analysis. We will utilise the various text packages to evaluate the data
and provide scores for the related terms in the dataset. The ultimate goal is to create a sentiment
analysis model that can recognise whether words are good or negative, as well as their
magnitude. The code is separated into many sections: importing data, creating a corpus, cleaning
text, creating a term-document matrix, visualisation, and sentiment analysis.
